A number of language packs and style localisations are available on the official website
(http://www.phpbb.com/) or its official repositories, like GitHub (http://github.com/phpbb/).
This is the only official locations for all supported language sets. If you download a package
from a 3rd party site you do so with the understanding that the phpBB Group and the majority of
teams for different international support sites do not offer support.
